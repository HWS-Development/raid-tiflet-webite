    "lead": "Once the home of a Berber spice merchant, Dar Tiflet has witnessed generations pass by — along with their fragrances and family stories. Today, this century-old house has been completely restored, in keeping with its original spirit. Traditional architecture — vaults, zelliges, a central patio — now blends harmoniously with cleaner lines, soft colors, and decidedly modern comfort. Here, every detail tells a story: a floor pattern, a hand-painted wall, a lantern lighting a quiet alcove. The atmosphere is calm, bright, and welcoming, reflecting Berber hospitality — sincere, generous, and discreet.",
